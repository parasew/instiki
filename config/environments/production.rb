# Unfortunately, the above does not work well under Mongrel, as the default Ruby logger class
# does no locking and you will have several processes running, each wanting to write to (and 
# rotate) the log file. One solution is to have each mongrel instance writes to a different log file:
#   http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2006/11/14/configure-mongrel-rails-logger-per-port for a solution.
# Another is to use the default logging behaviour (comment out the above line)
# and use an external program (e.g. logrotate) to rotate the logs.
