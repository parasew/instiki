NAME
       bundle-config - Set bundler configuration options

SYNOPSIS
       bundle config [name [value]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  allows you to interact with bundler's configuration sys-
       tem. Bundler retrieves its configuration  from  the  local  application
       (app/.bundle/config), environment variables, and the user's home direc-
       tory (~/.bundle/config), in that order of priority.

       Executing bundle config with no parameters will print  a  list  of  all
       bundler configuration for the current bundle, and where that configura-
       tion was set.

       Executing bundle config <name> will print the value of that  configura-
       tion setting, and where it was set.

       Executing  bundle  config <name> <value> will set that configuration to
       the value specified for all bundles executed as the current  user.  The
       configuration  will  be	stored in ~/.bundle/config. If name already is
       set, name will be overridden and user will be warned.

       Executing bundle config --global  <name>  <value>  works  the  same  as
       above.

       Executing bundle config --local <name> <value> will set that configura-
       tion to the local application. The  configuration  will	be  stored  in
       app/.bundle/config.

       Executing  bundle  config --delete <name> will delete the configuration
       in both local and global  sources.  Not	compatible  with  --global  or
       --local flag.

       Executing bundle with the BUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG environment variable set
       will cause it to ignore all configuration.

       Executing bundle config disable_multisource true upgrades  the  warning
       about the Gemfile containing multiple primary sources to an error. Exe-
       cuting bundle config --delete disable_multisource downgrades this error
       to a warning.

BUILD OPTIONS
       You  can use bundle config to give bundler the flags to pass to the gem
       installer every time bundler tries to install a particular gem.

       A very common example, the mysql gem, requires Snow  Leopard  users  to
       pass  configuration  flags  to gem install to specify where to find the
       mysql_config executable.



	   gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config



       Since the specific location of that executable can change from  machine
       to machine, you can specify these flags on a per-machine basis.



	   bundle config build.mysql --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config



       After  running  this  command,  every time bundler needs to install the
       mysql gem, it will pass along the flags you specified.

CONFIGURATION KEYS
       Configuration keys in bundler have two forms: the  canonical  form  and
       the environment variable form.

       For  instance,  passing	the  --without	flag to bundle install(1) bun-
       dle-install.1.html prevents  Bundler  from  installing  certain	groups
       specified  in  the Gemfile(5). Bundler persists this value in app/.bun-
       dle/config so that calls to Bundler.setup do not try to find gems  from
       the  Gemfile that you didn't install. Additionally, subsequent calls to
       bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html remember this setting and  skip
       those groups.

       The  canonical  form of this configuration is "without". To convert the
       canonical form to the environment variable  form,  capitalize  it,  and
       prepend	BUNDLE_.  The  environment  variable form of "without" is BUN-
       DLE_WITHOUT.

       Any periods in the configuration keys must be replaced with two	under-
       scores when setting it via environment variables. The configuration key
       local.rack becomes the environment variable BUNDLE_LOCAL__RACK.

LIST OF AVAILABLE KEYS
       The following is a list of all configuration keys  and  their  purpose.
       You  can  learn	more  about  their operation in bundle install(1) bun-
       dle-install.1.html.

       o   path (BUNDLE_PATH): The location on disk where  all	gems  in  your
	   bundle will be located regardless of $GEM_HOME or $GEM_PATH values.
	   Bundle gems not found in this location will be installed by	bundle
	   install.  Defaults  to Gem.dir. When --deployment is used, defaults
	   to vendor/bundle.

       o   frozen (BUNDLE_FROZEN): Disallow changes to the  Gemfile.  Defaults
	   to true when --deployment is used.

       o   without  (BUNDLE_WITHOUT):  A :-separated list of groups whose gems
	   bundler should not install

       o   bin (BUNDLE_BIN): Install executables from gems in  the  bundle  to
	   the specified directory. Defaults to false.

       o   gemfile  (BUNDLE_GEMFILE): The name of the file that bundler should
	   use as the Gemfile. This location of this file also sets  the  root
	   of the project, which is used to resolve relative paths in the Gem-
	   file, among other things. By default, bundler will search  up  from
	   the current working directory until it finds a Gemfile.

       o   ssl_ca_cert	(BUNDLE_SSL_CA_CERT): Path to a designated CA certifi-
	   cate file or folder containing multiple  certificates  for  trusted
	   CAs in PEM format.

       o   ssl_client_cert (BUNDLE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT): Path to a designated file
	   containing a X.509 client certificate and key in PEM format.

       o   cache_path (BUNDLE_CACHE_PATH): The	directory  that  bundler  will
	   place  cached gems in when running bundle package, and that bundler
	   will look in when installing gems.

       o   disable_multisource (BUNDLE_DISABLE_MULTISOURCE):  When  set,  Gem-
	   files  containing  multiple	sources will produce errors instead of
	   warnings. Use bundle config --delete disable_multisource to	unset.

       o   ignore_messages (BUNDLE_IGNORE_MESSAGES): When set, no post install
	   messages will be printed. To silence a single gem, use dot notation
	   like ignore_messages.httparty true.



       In  general, you should set these settings per-application by using the
       applicable flag to the bundle install(1) bundle-install.1.html or  bun-
       dle package(1) bundle-package.1.html command.

       You  can  set  them globally either via environment variables or bundle
       config, whichever is preferable for your setup. If you use both,  envi-
       ronment variables will take preference over global settings.

LOCAL GIT REPOS
       Bundler	also  allows  you  to  work  against  a git repository locally
       instead of using the remote version. This can be achieved by setting up
       a local override:



	   bundle config local.GEM_NAME /path/to/local/git/repository



       For example, in order to use a local Rack repository, a developer could
       call:



	   bundle config local.rack ~/Work/git/rack



       Now instead of checking out the remote git repository, the local  over-
       ride  will  be used. Similar to a path source, every time the local git
       repository change, changes will be automatically picked up by  Bundler.
       This  means  a commit in the local git repo will update the revision in
       the Gemfile.lock to the local git repo revision. This requires the same
       attention  as git submodules. Before pushing to the remote, you need to
       ensure the local override was pushed, otherwise you may point to a com-
       mit that only exists in your local machine.

       Bundler	does many checks to ensure a developer won't work with invalid
       references. Particularly, we force a developer to specify a  branch  in
       the  Gemfile  in  order to use this feature. If the branch specified in
       the Gemfile and the current branch in the local git repository  do  not
       match,  Bundler	will  abort.  This  ensures that a developer is always
       working against the correct branches, and prevents  accidental  locking
       to a different branch.

       Finally,  Bundler  also	ensures  that the current revision in the Gem-
       file.lock exists in the local git repository. By  doing	this,  Bundler
       forces you to fetch the latest changes in the remotes.

MIRRORS OF GEM SOURCES
       Bundler	supports  overriding gem sources with mirrors. This allows you
       to configure rubygems.org as the gem source in your Gemfile while still
       using your mirror to fetch gems.



	   bundle config mirror.SOURCE_URL MIRROR_URL



       For example, to use a mirror of rubygems.org hosted at



	   bundle config mirror.http://rubygems.org http://rubygems-mirror.org



CREDENTIALS FOR GEM SOURCES
       Bundler	allows	you to configure credentials for any gem source, which
       allows you to avoid putting secrets into your Gemfile.



	   bundle config SOURCE_HOSTNAME USERNAME:PASSWORD



       For example, to save the credentials of	user  claudette  for  the  gem
       source at gems.longerous.com, you would run:



	   bundle config gems.longerous.com claudette:s00pers3krit



       Or you can set the credentials as an environment variable like this:



	   export BUNDLE_GEMS__LONGEROUS__COM="claudette:s00pers3krit"
